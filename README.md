Data Scripts
============

This repo is for scripts I used while studying the encoding of multiview video using the JVT's JMVC reference software.

The format\_data.sh script takes a file output directly from an encoding of a video stream with the reference software
and transforms it into readable columns containing the picture viewing order, frame type, Y PSNR value, and size in bits.

The plot.gp script uses files generated by format\_data.sh and plots the frame vs size and frame vs PSNR, labeling each point
with the frame type. The script expects the data files to be located at ${encode\_version}/stream${stream\_id}.dat. It accepts the encode version and the first and last stream numbers as arguments,
i.e. `gnuplot -e "ver=3; start=0; end=7;" plot.gp`

This was tested using gnuplot 4.6.
